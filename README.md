# NixOS Config

This repository holds my configuration for NixOS, for my personal laptop, using flakes. The configuration without flakes can be found till this commit on [GitHub](https://github.com/iAmMrinal0/nix-config/tree/015b9b9d522abdd703e7865878b9c4fc9793b983)
User config is managed by [home-manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager/)

## Usage

(To be updated for flakes)

Any feedback and suggestions to improve are welcome. :)

<b>PS:</b> If you are interested in dotfiles, maybe my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/iammrinal0/dotfiles) is worth a look.
